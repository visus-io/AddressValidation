# Google Integration

AddressValidation offers a complete integration to the [Google Address Validation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/overview) to provide validation for over [39 countries](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/coverage).

## Credentials

Before utilizing the integration, the setup and configuration of a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) is required. 
It is assumed that an active project with the [Google Address Validation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/overview) enabled and available.

To create the service account, you can refer to the following [article](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create#iam-service-accounts-create-console), or if you have access to the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/cli?hl=en) you can run the following:

```Bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create $SA_NAME \
    --description="Address Validation Service" \
    --display-name="Address Validation Service"
```

After the service account has been created, it will need to be granted a [Domain-wide Delegation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/162106?hl=en#zippy=%2Cset-up-domain-wide-delegation-for-a-client) for the scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`. You can execute the following command to get the `oauth2ClientId` value, otherwise you can retrieve it from the [service accounts dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) under the heading `OAuth 2 Client ID`:

```Bash
gcloud iam service-accounts describe $SA_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Finally, create your [service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#iam-service-account-keys-create-gcloud) and store it in a safe location as it will be needed later.

```Bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create /tmp/$SA_NAME-key.json \
    --iam-account=$SA_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

> [!NOTE]
> There are no plans to support [API Key authentication](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/get-api-key) at this time.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the integration into a project is through NuGet:

# [.NET CLI](#tab/tab-ave-google-cli)
```Shell
dotnet package add Visus.AddressValidation.Integration.Google
```
# [Package Manager](#tab/tab-ave-google-pm)
```PowerShell
Install-Package Visus.AddressValidation.Integration.Google
```
---

At application startup, you will need to register the integration with the [Microsoft DI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) container:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddGoogleAddressValidation();
```

[!INCLUDE [distributed-cache-required](../includes/distributed-cache-required.md)]

## Configuration

Configuration of the integration is relatively straight forward and **all** parameters are read through an `IConfiguration` instance.
The necessary configuration values can be extracted from the `$SA_NAME-key.json` file that was produced earlier in the [credentials](#credentials) step.

| Key                                      | JSON Field   |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `VS_AVE_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`       | client_email |
| `VS_AVE_GCP_PROJECT_ID`                  | project_id   |
| `VS_AVE_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` | private_key  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Formatting of the `private_key` value **must** be preserved.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `VS_AVE_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` should be stored encrypted at rest. See the [Security(../index.md#security) for additional details.

## Standard Example

With the setup and configuration now complete, you can leverage the validator:

```csharp
public class ValidateController(IAddressValidationService<GoogleAddressValidationRequest> validationService)
{
    private readonly IAddressValidationService<GoogleAddressValidationRequest> _validationService = validationService ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(validationService));
    
    [HttpGet]
    public async ValueTask<IActionResult> Get()
    {
        new GoogleAddressValidationRequest
        {
            AddressLines =
            {
                "1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy"
            },
            CityOrTown = "Mountain View",
            StateOrProvince = "CA",
            PostalCode = "94043",
            Country = CountryCode.US
        };
        
        IAddressValidationResponse? response = await ValidationService.ValidateAsync(request);
        
        return response is null
            ? new NoContentResult()
            : new OkObjectResult(response);
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> [`EnableUspsCass`](xref:Visus.AddressValidation.Integration.Google.Http.GoogleAddressValidationRequest#Visus_AddressValidation_Integration_Google_Http_GoogleAddressValidationRequest_EnableUspsCass) is a computed property and will only be `true` if the Country is `US`.

> [!TIP]
> When re-validating an address, be sure to set the property [`PreviousResponseId`](xref:Visus.AddressValidation.Integration.Google.Http.GoogleAddressValidationRequest#Visus_AddressValidation_Integration_Google_Http_GoogleAddressValidationRequest_PreviousResponseId) value within [`GoogleAddressValidationRequest`](xref:Visus.AddressValidation.Integration.Google.Http.GoogleAddressValidationRequest). The value can be retrieved from the [`CustomResponseData`](xref:Visus.AddressValidation.Model.IAddressValidationResponse#Visus_AddressValidation_Model_IAddressValidationResponse_CustomResponseData) dictionary with the key `responseId`.
